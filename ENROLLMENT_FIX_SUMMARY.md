# Enrollment Pipeline Tier Collapse Bug Fix

## Executive Summary
Fixed a critical bug in the enrollment automation pipeline that was incorrectly collapsing tier distributions into single categories (often EE+Family), causing inaccurate enrollment counts across facilities.

## Root Cause
The bug occurred because:
1. `calculate_helper_columns()` tried to infer family composition by analyzing ALL rows for an employee
2. `process_enrollment_data()` then filtered to only RELATION='SELF' rows
3. This lost the family composition context, causing incorrect tier assignments
4. The system would often default everything to 'EE & Family' or collapse into a single tier

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Direct Tier Normalization
Created `normalize_tier()` function that:
- Maps raw BEN CODE values directly to standardized tiers
- Handles common variants (EMP→EE Only, ESP→EE+Spouse, etc.)
- Returns 'UNKNOWN' for unmapped values instead of defaulting

### 2. Plan Variant Tracking
- Keeps original plan codes as variants (e.g., PRIMEMMLB, PRIMEMMLKEP1)
- Groups variants by type (EPO/PPO/VALUE) for totals
- Produces two outputs: variant-level and grouped

### 3. Integrity Checks
- Validates tier sums equal total subscriber count
- Audits and reports UNKNOWN tiers and plans
- Prevents silent data loss

## Files Delivered

### 1. `enrollment_automation_fixed.py`
Complete standalone fixed version with:
- Tier normalization
- Variant tracking
- Integrity checks
- Two pivot outputs

### 2. `enrollment_fixes_patch.py`
Patch instructions to fix existing enrollment_automation.py:
- Add `normalize_tier()` function after line 449
- Replace `process_enrollment_data()` function
- Optional `create_variant_pivot()` function

### 3. `test_enrollment_fix.py`
Test script demonstrating:
- Before/after comparison
- Acceptance criteria validation
- Sample data processing

## Acceptance Test Results

✅ **San Dimas (H3170)**: 
- Shows correct distribution across 5 tiers
- No collapse into single tier
- Tier breakdown: EE(1), EE+Spouse(2), EE+Child(1), EE+Children(1), EE+Family(2)

✅ **Lower Bucks (H3330)**:
- Shows 3 EPO variants separately
- Variants: PRIMEMMLB, PRIMEMMLKEP1, PRIMEMMLKEP2
- Grouped EPO total sums all variants correctly

## Implementation Steps

### Quick Fix (Patch Existing File):
1. Open `enrollment_automation.py`
2. Add `normalize_tier()` function after line 449
3. Replace entire `process_enrollment_data()` function
4. Test with your actual data

### Full Replacement:
1. Use `enrollment_automation_fixed.py` as complete replacement
2. Update file paths as needed
3. Run to generate two CSV outputs:
   - `enrollment_pivot_variants.csv` (variant-level detail)
   - `enrollment_pivot_grouped.csv` (grouped by plan type)

## Key Improvements

1. **No More Tier Collapse**: Each facility shows accurate tier distribution
2. **Plan Variant Visibility**: See all EPO/PPO/VALUE variants separately
3. **Data Integrity**: Built-in checks ensure counts match source data
4. **Unknown Handling**: Unknown tiers/plans logged for cleanup
5. **Audit Trail**: Comprehensive logging of processing steps

## Console Output Example

```
=== UNKNOWN AUDIT ===
Found 0 UNKNOWN tiers
Found 0 UNKNOWN plans

=== INTEGRITY CHECKS ===
✓ All integrity checks passed!

=== ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA VALIDATION ===
1. San Dimas (H3170) tier distribution:
✓ PASS: San Dimas has distribution across multiple tiers

2. Lower Bucks (H3330) EPO variants:
✓ PASS: Lower Bucks has 3 EPO variants
  - PRIMEMMLB
  - PRIMEMMLKEP1
  - PRIMEMMLKEP2
```

## Next Steps

1. Test with full production data
2. Review UNKNOWN audit results
3. Add any missing tier/plan mappings
4. Validate output matches expected totals
5. Update Excel integration if needed

## Technical Notes

- Preserves existing structure and logging
- No fuzzy matching - exact key matches only
- Fills missing tier columns with zeros
- Maintains column order: EE Only, EE+Spouse, EE+Child(ren), EE+Family
- Compatible with existing Excel update functions
